      <description>This task initially appeared challenging and overwhelming, but by the end, it seemed straightforward and simple.
I began by installing Hugo and creating two GitHub repositories named &amp;ldquo;hugo&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;adarshs05.github.io.&amp;rdquo; I cloned both repositories into my Linux terminal. Next, I navigated to the &amp;ldquo;hugo&amp;rdquo; repository and used the command &amp;ldquo;hugo new site sreeniche&amp;rdquo; to create a new directory containing all the necessary tools and files to build the website.
To gain a better understanding of the process, I referred to a YouTube tutorial.</description>

What would you do? Well, this is just a hypothetical question, but what if it really happened?</description>
